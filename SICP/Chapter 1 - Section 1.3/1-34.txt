Exercise 1.34.  
Suppose we define the procedure

(define (f g)
  (g 2))

Then we have

(f square)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1))))
6

What happens if we (perversely) ask the interpreter to evaluate the 
combination (f f)? Explain. 

(f g)
(f square)
(square 2)
4

(f (lambda (z) (* z (+ z 1)))
(* 2 3)
6

(f f)
(f 2)
(2 2)
This doesn't evaluate to anything...
